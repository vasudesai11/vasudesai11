### 🏃 Tech + Business | Data + Decisions | Code + Context

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at Symbiosis Institute of Technology (Final Year), with a strong interest in how **data, structure, and strategy** come together to solve real-world problems.

From writing Python scripts and designing dashboards, to structuring business problems using consulting tools — I love building things that are not just functional, but impactful.
